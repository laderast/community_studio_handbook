## What is WDL?

Workflow Description Language (WDL) is a way to describe a processing pipeline

## How is it different from workflows like Snakemake?

WDL leverages reproducible software environments called containers rather than relying on pre-installed software. File paths to installed software may not be consistent, and creating a combination of software packages that work on another system can be difficult.

By bundling software and their dependencies into a *container*, the same exact software environment can be reproduced across multiple machines and operating systems.

Theoretically, given a WDL file, you should be able to reproduce and scale an analysis pipeline.
